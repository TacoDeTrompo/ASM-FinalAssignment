# ASM Final Assignment

This is my final assignment for my ASM class in university

The missing png files can be found here:
- mario sprite.png: https://www.vg-resource.com/archive/index.php/thread-22879.html

- backgrounds.png: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u0aPRl28JdjY49Dc13s-SrDXXThDK38p/view?usp=sharing (I wasn't able to find the original site where I downloaded it so I'll reuploaded and share the profile of the user who ripped it: https://www.spriters-resource.com/submitter/Beam+Luinsir+Yosho/)

- tiles.png: http://www.mariouniverse.com/wp-content/img/sprites/snes/smw/tiles.png

Just drop the files in the LENS_WinAPI folder and rename them to the names the code needs (mario sprite.png, backgrounds.png, tiles.png)
